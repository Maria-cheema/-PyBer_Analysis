# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

- The purpose of this challenge is to provide ridesharing data to help Pyber improve access to services provided and determine the affordability for undeserved neighborhoods. 
## 2. Results:
- The data below is by merging two dataset to give the summary of DataFrame by city type
-	By looking at the picture below, you can see the urban city have more total drivers as compared to total rides, which resulted to having the lowest average fare per ride and earned significantly less than Rural drivers. Although, rural city type had least number of total drivers with higher average fare per ride, the ratio of total rides to total drivers is the same to the Suburban city type. 

### Summary Dataframe by City Type

- In second picture all three cities shows the peak month to be end of February. Peak month for Urban city types last through April, whereas Rural and Suburban city types show decline by the month of March.

 ## 3. Summary:
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among city types
1.	Increase the number of drivers in Rural areas to meet the ride demand. 

2.	In Urban cities There are 2,405 drivers are only 1,625 rides, which constitutes for about 1 or none ride for many drivers. It would be helpful to cut down on the number of drivers in urban areas and by doing so will increase the average fare per driver.

3.	It would be helpful to have mileage distance data by PyBer as part of the data collection to give better understanding in calculating fare per minute and compare it among city types.
